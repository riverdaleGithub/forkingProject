# 🍴Fork & Build 🍴

## Project Types

In this project, you will collaborate with your peers by forking their code from Replit and building off it in three different ways:

## 🌱 Seedling: Refactor

A **Seedling** is a project where you will refactor a peer's codebase. Your task is to improve the existing code by optimizing its structure, readability, and efficiency. You will analyze the code, identify areas for improvement, and make the necessary modifications.

<details>
<summary>Seedling Rubric</summary>

| Criteria | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 📚 Code Comprehension | Demonstrates understanding of the existing code and its functionality |
| 🔄 Refactoring Techniques | Applies effective refactoring techniques to improve code quality |
| 💡 Problem Solving | Identifies and resolves any issues or errors encountered during refactoring |
| 🎨 Code Style and Readability | Enhances code structure, readability, and maintainability |

</details>

## 🌿 Bonsai: Expansion

A **Bonsai** is a project where you will expand upon a peer's existing codebase. You will add new features, enhance functionality, and improve the overall project. Your goal is to build upon the foundation provided by your peer and take it to the next level.
